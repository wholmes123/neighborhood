# San Diego Neighborhood Map Project

> Developed for Project of the **Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree**. 

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. 

Included is a list of my favorite hangouts in the San Diego of California. 

It allows you to filter the places and displays them on the map. 

# How To Use
1. Click on any of the places on the map / sidebar for more information
2. Type in the search bar if you only want to see a few of the places listed on the map to make it easier to spot.
